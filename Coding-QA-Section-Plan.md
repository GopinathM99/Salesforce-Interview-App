# Coding Q&A Homepage Section Plan

## Goal
Add a dedicated coding question-and-answer section to the homepage to encourage user engagement and provide quick access to technical interview practice resources.

## Key Outcomes
- Highlight featured coding Q&A content to drive traffic and showcase expertise.
- Provide fast discovery of questions filtered by topic and difficulty.
- Allow users to preview discussions before navigating to full detail pages.
- Ensure the section integrates seamlessly with existing homepage layout and performance budgets.

## Assumptions
- The homepage is built with the Next.js App Router and uses Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Coding questions and answers are stored in Supabase and can be retrieved via an existing or new API endpoint.
- Authentication is optional for viewing content but required for interactions (e.g., upvoting, bookmarking).

## Deliverables
1. **UI Layout**
   - Section header with concise title and link to full coding Q&A hub page.
   - Tabbed or pill-based filters for topics (e.g., Arrays, Dynamic Programming) and difficulty levels.
   - Responsive grid/list showcasing top questions with metadata (votes, answers, tags) and brief answer excerpt.
   - Call-to-action button for submitting a new question if the user is authenticated.

2. **Data Flow**
   - Client component to fetch featured questions via Supabase RPC or REST endpoint.
   - Loading and empty states, including graceful fallback messaging when data is unavailable.
   - Caching strategy leveraging Next.js `react-query` or `useSWR` (evaluate existing data-fetching approach) for smooth UX.

3. **Interactions**
   - Filter controls updating the displayed question list without a full page reload.
   - Click-through to dedicated question detail route.
   - Optional hover or focus states showing additional context (e.g., top answer summary).

4. **Accessibility & Responsiveness**
   - Ensure section header hierarchy maintains semantic order.
   - Provide keyboard-accessible filter controls with focus outlines.
   - Verify layout adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints without overflow.

5. **Analytics & Tracking**
   - Instrument section impressions and filter usage events (if analytics framework is available).
   - Track CTA clicks to measure question submission funnel.

6. **Content Management**
   - Determine if featured questions are curated manually or based on engagement metrics.
   - Document Supabase schema updates (if new table or view is required) and seed data expectations.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Discovery & Alignment**
   - Review current homepage layout and identify insertion point for the new section.
   - Confirm data availability and API requirements with backend owners.
2. **Design Mockups**
   - Produce low-fidelity wireframes followed by high-fidelity mocks covering light/dark modes.
   - Validate with stakeholders and iterate on feedback.
3. **Technical Design**
   - Define component hierarchy, props, and state management strategy.
   - Outline data-fetching method, caching, and error handling patterns.
4. **Backend Preparation**
   - Implement or update Supabase functions/views to support featured questions endpoint.
   - Add sample data for development/testing.
5. **Frontend Implementation**
   - Build UI components in isolation (Storybook or local playground if available).
   - Integrate components into homepage route with responsive Tailwind styling.
   - Wire up data fetching, loading states, and filter interactions.
6. **QA & Testing**
   - Write unit tests for data hooks and rendering states.
   - Conduct cross-browser and device testing; validate accessibility using axe or Lighthouse.
7. **Launch Checklist**
   - Update documentation and release notes.
   - Enable analytics dashboards for monitoring post-launch engagement.

## Open Questions
- Do we need moderation tools for community-submitted answers prior to surfacing them on the homepage?
- Should anonymous users have access to full Q&A content or only previews?
- Are there performance constraints that limit the number of questions displayed by default?

## Timeline Estimate
| Phase | Duration |
| --- | --- |
| Discovery & Alignment | 2-3 days |
| Design & Validation | 4-5 days |
| Technical Design | 2 days |
| Backend Preparation | 3-4 days |
| Frontend Implementation | 5-6 days |
| QA & Launch Prep | 3 days |

_Total estimated effort: 19-23 working days, assuming parallel work across design and engineering where possible._
